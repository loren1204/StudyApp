# Flashcard Viewer & Quiz App (SFML + C++)

A simple flashcard-based quiz application built using C++ and SFML. This app provides two modes: **Flashcard Mode** for studying and **Quiz Mode** for testing your knowledge interactively using keyboard input and a clean graphical interface.

##Controls

| Key           | Action                              |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| `Tab`         | Toggle between Flashcard and Quiz mode |
| `Space`       | Flip between Question/Answer (Flashcard mode) |
| `Left/Right`  | Navigate through flashcards (Flashcard mode) |
| `Enter`       | Submit answer (Quiz mode)            |

##How It Works

- **main.cpp**: Core logic that launches the SFML window and controls both study and quiz modes.
- **Flashcard Mode**: Displays question or answer text and allows flipping or navigating.
- **Quiz Mode**: Prompts for input, checks correctness, and displays instant feedback.
- Toggle between modes using the `Tab` key.
