*STUDYAPP 
Opening Statement 
Studying can be tedious and uninspiring, especially when repetition leads to boredom. 
StudyApp solves this by turning studying into an interactive, engaging experience. Inspired by the once-popular “Gravity” mode on Quizlet,
our platform brings back the fun—this time as a retro-style shooter game powered by your own flashcards.
Whether you're reviewing for an exam or brushing up on vocabulary, StudyApp transforms your flashcards into an arcade-style challenge.


*PROJECT OVERVIEW 
What problem does our platform solve?
- Traditional flashcard studying can become repetitive and disengaging, leading to poor retention and focus.
- Our application makes studying interactive, exciting, and rewarding by allowing students
   to play a game where correct answers fire weapons at approaching enemies. This method keeps the brain engaged and encourages accurate recall.

What makes our solution innovative or unique?
-Unlike most flashcard tools, our platform introduces:
-A retro arcade-style game where learning drives gameplay.
-A letter-by-letter input system for precision and spelling-focused practice.
-A modular main menu that lets users choose between Study Invaders or Review Mode.
-Custom flashcard file support—study anything, anytime.

Inspiration 
-StudyApp was inspired by the original "Gravity" mode in Quizlet, a beloved feature discontinued around 2022.
-Our team felt its absence deeply and sought to recreate—and improve upon—that experience in a new and nostalgic way.


Target Audience 
-StudyApp is ideal for:
-Students of all ages and education levels.
-Teachers who want to introduce gamified learning into their classrooms.
-Anyone looking to improve memory and recall through an interactive experience.

Key Features
-Main Menu Navigation:
-Choose between Review Mode (standard flashcard format) and Study Invaders (arcade-style game).
-Modular design allows independent operation of each feature.

Study Invaders Gameplay:
-15-round enemy wave system based on a flashcard file.
-Player types the correct term to shoot down the enemy.
-Missed answers cost lives—3 strikes and it’s game over!
-Features win/lose states, randomized bullet colors, and keyboard shortcuts.


UI & Design:
-Pixel-art inspired interface.
-Auto-wrapping definition box for readability.
-Retry screen and full keyboard control.

Learning Benefits:
-Reinforces spelling and term memorization.
-Encourages focus and active recall under time pressure.

Technology Stack
-We built our platform using:
-C++: Core game and logic.
-SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library): For graphics, text rendering, audio, and input handling.

Challenges & Innovations
-While the Review Mode and Study Invaders components work well individually, connecting both into a fully integrated menu-driven experience was challenging.
At this stage, only the Review Mode and Flashcard Viewer are directly connected through the menu. 
The Study Invaders game runs independently and will be merged into the main system in a future update.

Educational Impact
-StudyApp enhances traditional studying by:
-Encouraging correct spelling and recall.
-Making practice sessions more memorable and effective.
-Supporting personalized learning through custom flashcards.

*Next Steps & Improvements
-Link Study Invaders to the main menu for seamless access.
-Add high score tracking and more levels.
-Expand accessibility with difficulty modes and audio cues.
